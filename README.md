# My SPA Host App

This project is the **host application** in a micro-frontends architecture. It is responsible for serving and integrating multiple remote micro-frontend apps into a single cohesive user experience.

## Micro-Frontends

This host app loads and displays remote micro-frontends, allowing independent development and deployment of features. Each micro-frontend can be built and deployed separately, then integrated into the host at runtime.

### `npm start`

Runs the host app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
